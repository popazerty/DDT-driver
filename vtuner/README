Driver needs companion userspace applications from http://code.google.com/p/dreamtuner/

Devices permissions:

  Driver is registering the following devices:

    DVB:

    /dev/dvb/adapterX/demux0
    /dev/dvb/adapterX/dvr0
    /dev/dvb/adapterX/frontend0 [registered later]

    controlling:

    /dev/vtunerX

    where X is ordered by driver installation.

  All devices get default device permissions, what usually
  can't be exactly what we need (like 660 root/root).

  There is no simple way of changing permissions of
  created files from driver. 

  The only right(tm) way is using some upper layer
  subsystem. What means, int time of writing such notes,
  writing udev rules.

  This rule works:

  KERNEL=="vtunerc*", MODE="0666"
  
  put it in /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules (in Gentoo)

  ...
